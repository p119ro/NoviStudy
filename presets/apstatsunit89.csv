"**The 10% Condition:** a. Why is it necessary to check the 10% condition (sample size less than 10% of population size) when constructing a confidence interval for a population proportion? b. What happens to the capture rate if this condition is violated?","a. The 10% condition ensures that the sample is small enough relative to the population that removing each individual doesn't significantly change the remaining population's proportion.  This keeps the trials approximately independent, which is an assumption of the formulas used. b.

This Normality is crucial for using the z* critical value in the confidence interval calculation. b. If violated, the sampling distribution may be skewed, and the capture rate will likely be *lower* than the stated confidence level.
